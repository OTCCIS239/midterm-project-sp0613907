// You might connect to your database here. However, don't
// hard-code your database credentials here! Instead,
// copy the file `/.env.example` to `/.env`, and
// place your credentials there. Notice, this
// file shouldn't be in your repository.

// You can access the credentials you have defined in
// `/.env` by calling the `getenv($name)` function.
// For example, use `getenv('DB_HOST')` to get the
// host of your database. Yours should be "localhost"
